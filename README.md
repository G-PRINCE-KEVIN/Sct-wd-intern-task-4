#📝 Task 04 Completed – To-Do Web Application ✅

I developed a To-Do Web App that helps users manage their daily tasks with ease and stay organized.

✨ Key Features:
✅ Add, edit, and organize tasks in lists
✅ Mark tasks as completed
✅ Set date & time for tasks to stay on schedule
✅ Simple, clean, and responsive design

This project improved my skills in JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and user interface design, while focusing on building a practical productivity tool.

💡 Excited to keep working on more real-world projects that combine functionality with usability!
